## Product Description (150 words)

Stop rebuilding infrastructure. Start building AI features.

Levqor is a production-ready job orchestration API built for developers who want to ship automation fast—without the DevOps headache.

**What you get out of the box:**
- Built-in connectors (Gmail, Slack, Notion, Telegram) with OAuth managed for you
- Enterprise security (API keys, rate limiting, CORS) without configuration
- Autonomous monitoring (health checks, metrics, automated backups)
- RESTful API with comprehensive docs

**Why it matters:**
Traditional automation platforms require weeks building job queues, retry logic, and connector integrations. Levqor ships production-ready infrastructure so you can deploy workflows in minutes, not months.

Perfect for AI agents, workflow automation, data pipelines, and notification systems.

From MVP to production in hours. No ops team required.

**Try it free**: 1,000 jobs/month • All connectors included • Deploy in < 5 minutes

## First Comment (Maker's Introduction)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to launch Levqor — the job orchestration platform I wish existed when I was building AI automation.

**The problem I kept hitting:**
Every time I wanted to add automation to a project, I'd spend 2-3 weeks building the same infrastructure: job queues, retry logic, connector integrations, monitoring. The actual feature? Maybe 3 days of work. The ops? Weeks.

**So I built Levqor to fix this:**
Production-ready infrastructure that handles all the operational complexity, so you can ship automation features in hours instead of months.

**What makes it different:**
- **Managed connectors**: Gmail, Slack, Notion, Telegram with OAuth handled for you
- **Zero-config security**: API keys, rate limiting, CORS out of the box
- **Autonomous monitoring**: Health checks and backups without setting up observability
- **Actually production-ready**: 99.99% uptime, enterprise security, automated backups

**Perfect for:**
- AI startups building agent workflows
- SaaS companies adding automation features  
- Developers who hate DevOps (like me)

**Try it now**: Free tier includes 1,000 jobs/month and all connectors.

I'm here all day to answer questions, do demos, and hear your feedback. What automation are you building?

## Maker's Note

**What I learned building this:**

The hardest part of AI automation isn't the AI—it's making it reliable in production.

After rebuilding the same infrastructure 4 times for different projects, I realized every automation system needs the same foundation:
- Job orchestration with proper queuing
- Connector integrations with OAuth
- Error handling and retries
- Monitoring and alerting
- Security and rate limiting

Levqor packages all of this into a simple API. Instead of 3 weeks of ops work, you get production infrastructure in 5 minutes.

**What's next:**
- More connectors (taking requests!)
- Advanced scheduling and cron jobs
- Workflow visual builder
- Team collaboration features

**Current status:**
- 99.99% uptime since launch
- All core connectors operational
- SOC 2 Type 1 in progress
- 10,000+ jobs processed in beta

Would love your feedback on what connectors or features you need most!
