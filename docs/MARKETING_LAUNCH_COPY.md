### Short Description (60 chars)
Automate anything with natural language. Smarter than Zapier.

### Full Description
Levqor is the AI-native automation platform that lets you build powerful workflows in seconds—just describe what you want in plain English.

**Why Levqor beats traditional automation tools:**

🤖 **AI-First Design**: Describe your workflow, get a working automation instantly
⚡ **Enterprise-Ready**: Built-in security hardening, rate limiting, and abuse controls
🔌 **20+ Integrations**: Gmail, Slack, Notion, Telegram, Stripe, and more
💰 **Pay-As-You-Go**: No monthly fees until you need them ($0.10/workflow run)
🎯 **Zero Learning Curve**: If you can write an email, you can build automations

**Perfect for:**
- Startup founders automating their operations
- Developers building internal tools
- Teams tired of complex no-code builders
- Anyone who wants automation that "just works"

### Key Features
1. **Natural Language Workflows**: "Send me a Slack message when someone pays" → Done
2. **Smart Connector System**: Pre-built integrations with intelligent error handling
3. **Built-in Analytics**: Track every workflow run, error, and cost saving
4. **Partner Program**: 20% commission on referrals
5. **Production-Grade Infrastructure**: Redis queues, PostgreSQL, automatic backups

### Maker Story
Built by frustrated developers who were tired of clicking through endless UI builders. We wanted automation that understands intent, not just actions.

After 4 phases of hardening (security, scaling, monitoring, partner system), Levqor is now the most robust AI automation platform for serious users.

### First Comment (for engagement)
"Hi Product Hunt! 👋

We built Levqor because we were exhausted by traditional automation tools that require:
- Hours of setup
- Complex visual builders
- Monthly subscriptions before you even know if it works

With Levqor, you just *describe* what you want and it builds the workflow for you.

Example: 'Email me when someone signs up and their payment exceeds $100'
→ Levqor creates the trigger, filter, and action automatically.

We've processed this through 4 development phases to make it production-ready:
- Phase 1: AI workflow builder
- Phase 2: Infrastructure (Redis, monitoring, 20 connectors)
- Phase 3: Growth systems (referrals, emails, billing)
- Phase 4: Security hardening (rate limiting, webhook verification, backup automation)
- Phase 5: Partner program & revenue dashboard (launching today!)

Would love your feedback! What's the first workflow you'd automate?

Special launch offer: First 100 signups get 100 free credits ($10 value) 🎁"
