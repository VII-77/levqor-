# Automate Everything from Your Phone

Business doesn't stop when you leave your desk. Neither should your automation capabilities.

## Mobile-First Automation

Levqor's platform works seamlessly on mobile devices. Whether you're on an iPhone, Android, or tablet, you can:

- **Create workflows** using voice-to-text: "Send daily sales reports to my team"
- **Monitor executions** with real-time notifications
- **Manage integrations** without touching a terminal
- **View analytics** on responsive dashboards

## Real-World Scenarios

### On a Flight
Your customer sends an urgent request. From your phone, you create a Levqor workflow that:
1. Monitors your inbox for priority emails
2. Extracts key information
3. Posts to your team's Slack channel
4. Creates a Notion task with context

All done before your plane lands.

### Weekend Emergency
A system alert fires on Saturday morning. From your phone:
- Check Levqor's dashboard to see what triggered
- Review execution logs
- Temporarily disable the workflow if needed
- Schedule a proper fix for Monday

No laptop. No VPN. No stress.

## The Future is Mobile

Automation platforms were built for desktop developers. Levqor was built for modern business people who work from anywhere.
