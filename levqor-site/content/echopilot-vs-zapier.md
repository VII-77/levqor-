# EchoPilot vs Zapier: Why AI Makes the Difference

Zapier revolutionized automation by making it accessible. But in 2025, manually connecting triggers and actions feels outdated. Here's why Levqor's AI-first approach is the future.

## The Old Way: Manual Configuration

With Zapier and Make.com, you need to:
1. Choose a trigger from hundreds of options
2. Map fields manually
3. Configure conditional logic with dropdowns
4. Test and debug when something breaks
5. Maintain workflows as APIs change

This works, but it's time-consuming and requires technical knowledge.

## The Levqor Way: Describe, Don't Configure

With Levqor, you simply describe what you want:

> "When I get an email from a customer, summarize it and post to our #support Slack channel"

Levqor's AI:
- Understands natural language intent
- Selects appropriate connectors automatically
- Configures field mappings intelligently
- Handles errors gracefully
- Adapts to API changes without manual intervention

## Real-World Example

**Zapier approach:** 15 minutes to configure a Gmail → Slack workflow  
**Levqor approach:** 30 seconds to describe and deploy

The time savings compound as your automation complexity grows.

## The Bottom Line

If you enjoy clicking through configuration screens, stick with Zapier. If you want automation that understands what you're trying to achieve, try Levqor.
