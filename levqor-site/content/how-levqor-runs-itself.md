# How Levqor Runs Itself

At Levqor, we don't just build automation tools—we live and breathe them. Our entire operation runs on our own platform, demonstrating the power and reliability of AI-driven automation.

## Self-Healing Infrastructure

Our backend monitors its own health and automatically scales resources based on demand. When traffic spikes, Levqor detects the pattern and provisions additional capacity before performance degrades.

## Automated Customer Communication

Every support email, billing notification, and security alert is routed through Levqor workflows. We use our Slack connector to notify the team in real-time, our Gmail connector for customer communication, and our Notion connector to track issues.

## Continuous Deployment

Code changes trigger automated test suites, security scans, and gradual rollouts—all orchestrated by Levqor pipelines. If anything fails, the system automatically rolls back and alerts the team.

## The Result

By running on our own platform, we catch issues before our customers do, continuously improve based on real-world usage, and prove that Levqor can handle mission-critical operations at scale.
